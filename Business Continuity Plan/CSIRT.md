## Cyber Incident
When an organization's system are compromised, you often hear the term 'cyber security incident' rather than 'breach' or 'hack'

Incident sounds more harmless than 'breach' or 'hack', but it never means anything more positive, almost.
### Definition
Cyber incident is a word for the threats all organizations need to prepare for.

It does not mean the information is compromised, it only means that information is threatened.

### Response Management
The only viable way to make sure breach notifications are transparent is to have a CIRM system

This will help you identify and address threats promptly, ensuring that you know when and how a breach took place and what needs to be done to reduce the damage.
