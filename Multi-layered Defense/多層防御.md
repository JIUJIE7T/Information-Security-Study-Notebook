# Multi-layered Defense
## English
### Introduction(being modified)
  In the year of 2015, targeted threat became a hit topic in Japan, for simple single layered defense became not enough to defense all the cyber security threats.  
  
  The basic concept of multi-layered defense is to set multiple walls to defence cyber attack. No matter how complete the security policy/method is, there is always a posibility that the attack or hack can penetrate the defence boundary and keep on access the essential data inside a system.  
  
  The premise of this concept is __possible penatration__, any security method is not secured, as long as one defense boundary was passed, there should be always another way to keep the treate away from the system core.  
  
  For instance, the network was petrenated but the user end device can still prevent from being attack. The network defence was hacked but the information was still well protected and reaction could be taken on time.
